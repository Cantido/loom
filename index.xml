It is currently in development and not ready for use. Keep an eye on this space for a release announcement.
In short, Loom sequences event-based data and stores it for you. Sequencing events is important because it gives you a way to order events in a repeatable way. If you just relied on timestamps to order events, it is possible for clock jitter to alter the history of your data.</description></item></channel></rss>
